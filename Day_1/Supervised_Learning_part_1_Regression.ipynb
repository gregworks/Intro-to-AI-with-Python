    "**1. Linear Relationship** \n",
    "\n",
    "First, linear regression needs the relationship between the independent and dependent variables to be linear.  It is also important to check for outliers since linear regression is sensitive to outlier effects.  The linearity assumption can best be tested with scatter plots\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Normal Distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the linear regression analysis requires all variables to be multivariate normal it can be checked with a histogram or Q-Q plot. When the data is not normally distributed it's possible a non-linear transformation (e.g., log-transformation) might fix this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Low to No Multicollinearity**\n",

    "\n",
    "**4. Low to No Auto-correlation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression analysis requires that there is little or no autocorrelation in the data.  Autocorrelation occurs when the residuals are not independent from each other.  In other words when the value of y(x+1) is not independent from the value of y(x). Examples are signal processing or time series data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Homoscedasticity**\n",

    "\n",
    "**6. Independent features**\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent features are in no way derived from other features. Otherwise, we have a problem when interpreting the model since we expect to interpret our outputs as X increase in feature A drives an increase of Y units of the response variable. However, if features are correlated, you lose the ability to interpret the linear regression model because you violate a fundamental assumption."
