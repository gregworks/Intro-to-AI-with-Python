    "We've covered many new subjects in this course. Now it's time to put your knowlege to the test. We'll be using a sample of a credit card transaction dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download)\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with **classifying** transactions as fraudulent or not. Use multiple machine learning methods introduced in the course. Start with a Logistic Regression and then try to improve it by clustering your feature data and adding the cluster labels as a feature themself. Compare results and report which model is your best estimator. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `creditcard_transactions.csv` provided in the data folder, do the following:\n",
    "> 1. Install & import all necessary tools into your notebook\n",
    "> 1. Read in your dataset\n",
    "> 1. Get an understanding of the distribution of each column (5 number summaries i.e. \"describe\" it!)\n",
    "> 1. Visualize your data\n",
    "> 1. Create a correlation matrix and write down any features that look like they could be correlated\n",
    "> 1. Define your features, X, and your target, y\n",
    "> 1. Split your data into a training set and a testing set\n",
    "> 1. Build a logistic regression model\n",
    "> 1. Evaluate your model's performance \n",
    "> 1. Now, using k-means cluster your features and add the cluster labels to X as an additional feature\n",
    "> 1. Re-run logistic regression with the new feature and see if your results improved in the evaluation step\n",
